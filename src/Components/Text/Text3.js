    `I started The DevMountain immersive Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp on June 1st. I graduated with honors or 'Badging' as they call it at DevMountain, this means I turned in All required assignments and passed with 80% or more on all my projects and assesments. We focused on learning the full stack required to build and host a functioning web application connected to a database. The cirriculum was designed to bring a student from zero to jr developer in 13 weeks. After passing an inital assesment to be accepted into the bootcamp the first several weeks are focused on learning the fundementals of javascript, html-5 and css. We practiced making wireframes from a figma, building and deisgning web pages using a combination of html and css. We learned the difference between functional and object orinented programming, javascripts built in API's for working with objects, arrays, strings, and numbers, the context of this and other javascript fundementals. 
    The next several weeks we focused on learning React.js. We started with learning component lift cycle methods and basic debugging. Then we learned about https, rest, crud axios and the difference between Synchronous/Asynchronous code. The lessons then combined React with Node.js. We learned how express works and how it connects with endpoints and axios. We learned about node package mananger and my favorite Yarn. We created severs and our own API's. After that the school focused on controllers, middleware and how to work PostMan to check endpoints.
    After the first month the students that sucesfully made it were taught media queries, animations and transitions, before I was asked to complete my first project. This can be found on ${<a href='https://github.com/Most-Basic33/shelfiev'> Github</a>}
